# RP6502 SDK

This is for [CC65](https://cc65.github.io/). If you prefer another tool, such as [64tass](https://tass64.sourceforge.net/) or [KickAssembler](http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler), the `include` files and `rp6502.py` may be useful.

Begin with the VSCode scaffolding: [rp6502-vscode](https://github.com/picocomputer/rp6502-vscode)
